            <h1>Annotate Video up to 100x Faster</h1>

            <p>Systems for monitoring have become indispensable in the conservation of elephants. These systems run on machine learning models that automate tracking. But these models must be trained on a great deal of human-generated data. You must first have real people track elephants in actual footage. This process can be costly.</p>

            <p>How do we reduce the cost of gathering quality human annotations of video data?</p>

            <p><img src="/assets/video/Video Annotation-dark.png" /></p>

            </div>
        </div> 

        <h2>The Problem</h2>

        <p><b>As a data scientist, I need to gather human-generated video object tracking data so that I can train my machine learning model.</b></p>

        <p>I was the lead product designer on the project. In addition to UI/UX and visual design, I conducted research, user testing and rapid code prototyping.</p>

        <div class="visual-container">
            <div class="inner">
                <p><video autoplay loop muted>
                    <source src="/assets/video/elephant.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                    Your browser does not support the video tag.
                </video></p>
                <p><span class="caption">Creating training data for elephant tracking.</span></p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>Initial Research</h2>

        <p>Our target users were data scientists and crowdsource annotators.</p>

        <p>We kicked off the project by identifying existing and prospective users who could serve as sounding boards in the design of our solution. Working with these partners helped us to develop user stories, product requirements, and initial wireframe sketches.</p>

        <p>We talked to data scientists about their video data, the objects to be annotated and requirements for accuracy. We asked about existing pain points and about the value of our team solving these pain points. This helped us to define success metrics, the most crucial of which was to gather quality annotations 10X faster than a competitive tool.</p>

        <p>Equally important were our crowdsource annotators. We discussed the kinds of work they seek, their obstacles to success and the value our platform provides to them. We conducted a remote design thinking session with several contributors located in different parts of the world.</p>

        <p>We also did a competitive analysis to understand similar tools, particularly some of the most successful canvas drawing tools out there.

                <p><span class="caption">Documentation from a remote design thinking session.</span></p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>Ideation</h2>

        <p>Data scientists need a path to upload their video data onto the platform. They need to write instructions for how to annotate their data and they need to create and launch a job with their data to put in front of annotators.</p>

        <p>We realized that a crucial component of this new offering would be a modular tool to annotate video. This would be a highly specialized tool with interactions more commonly seen in canvas drawing tools such as Photoshop.</p>

                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>Iterative Prototyping</h2>

        <p>I worked in Sketch and Invision to create prototypes from concept to high fidelity. We routinely met with our stakeholder partners to show them the prototypes and validate our design decisions.</p>

        <div class="visual-container one-column">
            <div class="inner">
                <p><img src="/assets/video/lo-fi_2.png" /></p>
                <p><span class="caption">Lo-Fi mocks created in Sketch.</span></p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Code Prototyping</h3>

        <p>We also coded working prototypes throughout the iterative design proccess. These helped to bring our concepts to life in a way that was closer to the true end-user experience.</p>

        <div class="visual-container one-column">
            <div class="inner">
            <p data-height="450" data-theme-id="light" data-slug-hash="eKmMaZ" data-default-tab="result" data-user="jcloughley" data-pen-title="Ontology Sidebar" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/jcloughley/pen/eKmMaZ/">Ontology Sidebar</a> by Joe C (<a href="https://codepen.io/jcloughley">@jcloughley</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.

            <p><span class="caption">A code prototype for sidebar behavior.</span></p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Handoff</h3>

        <p>When the data scientist flows and the annotator tool prototype were validated enough for a first release, I moved into visual design and worked closely with our front end team to create the production-ready implementation.</p>

        <p>The offering was initially put into the hands of our stakeholder partners. We remained in touch with these users to continue improving the experience after the initial release.</p>

        <h2>Outcomes</h2>

        <p>We tested to see if the new offering met our success metric of enabling annotations 10X faster than the competitive tool. The new tool was found to enable annotations 100X faster. Within the year this tool opened up new use cases for existing customers and brought in signifigant new revenue.</p>

        <p>The design solution was granted US patent <a target="_blank" href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US10489918B1">10489918B1</a>.</p>
