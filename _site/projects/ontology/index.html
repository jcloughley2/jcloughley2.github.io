        <h1>Manage a Scalable Ontology</h1>

        <p>An important part of gathering training data is deciding what types of ‘things’ exist in the data. With respect to AI and Machine Learning, this collection of classes is called an ontology.</p>

        <p>For those modeling emergency response calls, raw audio clips may get presented with an ontology of Speaker 1, Speaker 2, and Background Noise. An annotator would then label the audio clips accordingly.</p>

        <p>How can a data scientist effectively manage and deploy an ontology for data annotation?</p>

        <h2>The Problem</h2>

        <p><b>As a data scientist, I need a way to create and manage a list of 'things' that exist in my data so that others can properly label my data for model training.</b></p>

        <p>I was the lead product designer on the project. In addition to UI/UX and visual design I conducted research and user testing. Much of my focus during this time was on the businesses entire suite of annotation tools. I designed these tools and each one was designed to connect to this new ontology management experience.</p>

        <div class="visual-container one-column">
            <div class="inner">
                <p><img src="/assets/ontology/concept-audio-ontology.png" /></p>
                <p><span class="caption">The ontology for this audio clip is Speaker 1, Speaker 2 and Background Noise.</span></p>
            </div>
        </div> 

        <h2>Initial Discovery</h2>

        <p>The team and I worked closely with sponsored users: select customers who could use and benefit from the solution we set out to create. By working with them, we were able to understand the exact pain points of the problem and understand what value a new solution could bring.</p>

        <p>Below are a few questions we discussed with these users. Many of these questions we returned to with each new iteration.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>What is your current process?</li>
            <li>What is painful about the experience?</li> 
            <li>What would be the optimal/expected inputs and outputs?</li>
            <li>(Based on X prototype) would it serve your needs?</li>
            <li>(Based on X prototype) how might you be blocked from success?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Below are some of our initial learnings, gathered from sponsored users.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Prior to this project, ontologies were handled with customer created CSV files that were created offline and submitted to customer support via email. The support team would manually upload the files into an AWS bucket and pull them into the customers account with Javascript. The process was confusing, lengthy, and error prone.</li>
            <li>The information that is essential to a basic ontology is class title, representative color, and an output value.</li>
            <li>Users often struggle to even define what classes to include. Much work gets done to decide on ontology classes before the ontology is ready to use in the platform.</li>
        </ul>

            </div>
        </div> 

        <h2>Iterative Prototyping</h2>

        <p>I conducted multiple rounds of prototyping with increasing levels of fidelity. Designs were put in front of our sponsored users and other stakeholders for feedback. After each round I would incorporate feedback, providing variations and presenting artifacts as needed.</p>

        <h3>Concepts</h3>

        <p>For this phase we wanted to communicate the basic idea of managing a list of classes. We used this design to communicate the kind of information getting created and how it connects to the overall goal of our platform, annotating data. We borrowed patterns for basic list management.</p>

            <p><img src="/assets/ontology/ontology-initial-concept-1.png" /></p>
            <p><span class="caption">This concept was used to demonstrate an editable list of classes</span></p>
            <p><img src="/assets/ontology/ontology-initial-concept-2.png" /></p>
            <p><span class="caption">This concept was used to demonstrate how an ontology might plug into a tools.</span></p>
        </div>

        <h3>Lo-Fi to Hi-Fi</h3>

        <p>We wanted to nail down the information architecture considerations of the new experience. Where would ontologies be managed? Initially, the most optimal location was deemed out of scope as there would need to be major rearrangement of existing components.</p>

        <p>We settled on an alternative location but made design decisions that would allow for the experience to be 'relocated' in the future shoudl we invest more in this offering.</p>

            <p><img src="/assets/ontology/ontology-lo-fi-concept-2.png" /></p>
            <p><span class="caption">Ontology management where the user sets up their overall job design.</span></p>
        </div>

        <h3>Interactions</h3>

        <p>One of the most impactful interaction points of the handoff design was the ability to drag and drop to reorder and place classes. This interaction scaled well for when we introduced the idea that ontology classes could be nested within each other.</p>

        <p>Initially we allowed users to edit a class right in the list view, which helped with speed and efficiency. Though a solid interaction, we found that this wouldn’t scale. We anticipated that an ontology class would have much more information attached to it than what would be shown in the at-a-glance listing table. Ultimately, class editing was made to happen in a modal, a good decision given that rich HTML descriptions, predictive model pairing, and metadata were soon to get implemented.</p>

        <h3>Visual Design</h3>

        <p>The visual design leaned heavily on our design system and existing patterns. New, thoughtful styling and treatments were created to handle the drag and drop functionality, class expand/contract functionality and the pairing of a color (including the color picker).</p>

        <h2>Handoff</h2>

        <p>I worked closely with our front end team to create the production-ready implementation.</p>

            <p><span class="caption">This handoff design for when a new class is made or an existing class is edited.</span></p>

        <h3>Deep Dive on Smart Ontologies</h3>

        <p>As an example of an ontology use case, a data scientist might ask annotators to find all the ‘Dates’ present in text-based financial records.</p> 

        <p>Locating dates in text is not a unique endeavour and predictive models exist to identify dates in text generally. A predictive model could take a first pass to locate all dates. The annotator can then simply double check and correct those predictions, thus saving human effort and cost.</p> 

        <p>What if you could create an ontology class that pairs with a model to predict instances of that class, before an annotator reviews, corrects, and generally fills in the gaps? After finding evidence that predictions do save time, we set out to solve this problem.</p>

        <div class="visual-container one-column">
            <p><img src="/assets/ontology/ontology-smart-showcase-2.png" /></p>
            <p><span class="caption">The user can pair predictive models to run on the data before annotation begins.</span></p>
            <p><img src="/assets/ontology/ontology-smart-showcase-3.png" /></p>
            <p><span class="caption">Before pairing a predictive model, users want to see how well it performs.</span></p>
        </div>

        <h2>Outcomes</h2>

        <p>At first, this implementation was used as an ontology manager for just one annotation tool. Over the next two years the experience grew to include the following enhancements:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Manage Ontologies for Pixel-level annotation (Initial Offering)</li>
            <li>Introduce image shapes ontology</li>
            <li>Introduce video shapes ontology with multiple instances of each class.</li>
            <li>Include text annotation ontology. Introduce rich HTML descriptions.</li>
            <li>Add in the ability to nest classes.</li> 
            <li>Add the ability to pair predictive models across multiple data types.</li>
            <li>Add the ability to associate meta-data with each class.</li> 
        </ul>

        <p>Ultimately, we met each of these challenges. All said and done, the most rewarding aspect of building this experience was its ability to build off of and scale the initial offering. As new customer pain-points were identified solutions could be built off of the existing experience, validating the designs scalability and its influence on the company's roadmap.</p>
