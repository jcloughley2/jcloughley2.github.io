        <h3>Background</h3> 

        <p>Microtasking might sound quick and easy, but serious taskers work can work for long stretches of time. The nature of the work means taskers can work at any time in any setting, such as in the dark, or in the light of day. Also by nature, any small improvement to the experience of a microtask can lead to exponential increases in time and quality of results.</p>

        <p>Understanding these ideas led me and my team to find out where we could make the most improvement in the task of annotating and we discovered how beneficial a light/dark theme could be to our microtasking users.</p>
        
        <h3>Design Process</h3>

        <h4>Research</h4>

          <p>We researched when to have a light them and when to have a dark theme. we looked at research, articles, and looked at how other platofmrs handle this toggle</p>

                


                <p>To validate the need of a light/dark theme:</p>


        <p>We surveyed contributors to learn more abotu thier enviroment when they microtask and for how long they do it. </p>

<p>We interviewd a few microtasker participants to get more specific abotu their pain points.</p>


        <h4>Ideation</h4>


Our image and video annotation tool existed in a dark theme. We began to develop a tool for text annotation and used the oppurtunity to unify both tools under a dark and light theme. 

Trial and error

Coming up with a pallett.
